### Contact me

If you want to get in touch, the best way is always via email or SMS. If you don't have my email address or phone number, use this form and I will be in touch shortly.

<form action="//formspree.io/ghluska@gmail.com"
      method="POST">
    <input type="email" name="_replyto" placeholder="Your email">
    <textarea name="message" rows="5" placeholder="Your message"></textarea>
    <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>

I will never send you spam or otherwise contact you, except in relation to this exact message that you send. However, I use a gmail address, which is managed by Google.
