After the doldrums of the week between Christmas and New Years, I was excited to see some amazing articles start cropping up on various services. 

1. [The ghosts of Baha Mar: How a $3.5 billion paradise went bust] (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-04/the-ghosts-of-baha-mar-how-a-3-5-billion-paradise-went-bust)

I have been lucky enough to do quite a bit of business with Chinese companies and my experiences have always been positive. Granted, I am lucky because I have always found Chinese culture fascinating and dream of eventually becoming fluent in Mandarin. In my experience, having some understanding of Chinese culture makes many of the problems cited in this article moot, but then again, I have never worked with such big numbers. Either way, this is an excellent article about the absolutely worst case scenario for a major real estate project with an international cast of investors.

2. [Income inequality](http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html)

Paul Graham (founder of Viaweb/Y Combinator) is an absolute hero. His essays about starting and running successful high growth companies were the perfect supplement to business school. And his essays on Lisp convinced me that there was something to functional programming. Consequently, when he writes something controversial, I tend to look the other way - it isn't PG being a wrongheaded elitist. It is simply PG being PG. In this case though, try as I might, I can't understand what PG's many critics are talking about. Perhaps this is a sign that an unabashed fan boy, or maybe it's a sign that my ideas about economics are just skewed to those of the tech industry. But whatever it is, I agree with PG here.

3. [Three hundred programming interviews in thirty days] (https://data.triplebyte.com/three-hundred-programming-interviews-in-thirty-days-12c23c26b5ba#.ro12lhu8n)

I absolutely dropped the ball on this one. It was published one month ago, but I just found it today when it front paged Hacker News. Ammon Bartram though wrote an amazing, transparent article on what his startup (which builds better hiring processes for engineers) has learned from its first 30 days of operations. Definitely a must read for anyone hiring talent...even if the talent is not technical.
