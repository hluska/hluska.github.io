### About me

My name is Greg Hluska and I am a web developer, marketer, writer and entrepreneur from Regina, Canada. I especially like working with other entrepreneurs, analyzing complex problems and solving the most difficult problems in sometimes unorthodox ways. A graduate of the University of Regina's School of Business, some of my favourite topics include user experience (UX), front-end web development, quality assurance and user testing, and calculating the return on investment (ROI) from advertising.

When I'm not obsessing over conversion rates, entrepreneurship or another fucking MVC framework (because we really need 500 javascript MVC frameworks), I am an avid music fan who obsesses over vinyl, a climber who obsesses over mountains, and a baseball fan who obsesses over statistics. I used to cross country ski, but then I broke my right thumb, saw the light and realized that putting slippery boards on your feet and trudging through snow is not a sport, it is lunacy.

### About this site

My homepages have gone through an interesting transition over the last decade. When I first went back to University, I was a mostly anonymous blogger. But, then business school took over and the idea of owning hluska.ca started to seem more and more attractive.

Identity wasn't the only thing that shifted. In my first blogs, my content was rather diverse and in a given week, I could be expected to blog about everything from climate change to proportional representation to the absolute  superiority of whatever particular album I couldn't stop listening to then. Business came up, but it was mostly in reference to whatever new business idea I was working on.

Through the years, I have gotten more into analysis, but my subject matter was still all over the place. When I say 'all over the place', I mean that my five all-time most popular blog posts were about:

- problems with an earlier incarnation of HTML5.
- a referendum in Regina, Canada.
- my absolute disdain for growth hacking (or reasons why business should be about growing profits, not metrics like MAU or DAU)
- five surprising sources of usability analytics.
- the one year anniversary of M.C.A.'s death.

This website will be mostly about marketing and entrepreneurship.

To sum this site up, it is about marketing myself.

### About this site (technical)

When I first went online, the concept of serving content from a database was totally foreign to me. My site was all static HTML because that's just how it was done. Then, I made a few changes to my main menu, had to manually update that on 80 static HTML pages, and promptly got into PHP includes.

From there, it was an easy decision to start using Wordpress. WP made blogging so easy that it was my default choice for years and years and years.

But, a few years ago, I started using [http://www.leanpub.com](Leanpub) for long form writing and got kind of obsessed with Markdown. I found that armed with Git, Markdown and [fargo.io](Fargo.io), I was a significantly more productive writer. This severely hurt my blogging - going from my new flow back to Wordpress felt like jogging in quicksand. So, I started looking for new options.

Jekyll was instantly attractive to me and, since I was already using Git, I thought that for my next version of my website, I would try hosting my site on Github Pages. It feels funny writing an about page in a text editor - I have grown so used to Wordpress over the years that I associate writing for the web with its interfaace. It also feels funny knowing that after all these years, my website is fully static again.
