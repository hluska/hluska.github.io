My name is Greg Hluska (I pronounce it huh-luska) and I am a full stack digital marketer from Regina, Canada. A graduate of the University of Regina's School of Business, I have several years of experience founding companies (funded and bootstrapped), running marketing campaigns, doing sales, and building things for the web.

### What is a full stack digital marketer?

I am comfortable working throughout the entire digital stack. I can:

* Build a custom content management system (CMS).
* Deploy major open source content management systems and build custom themes or plugins. I have the most experience with Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla and Magento.
* Set up online payments with a particular emphasis on security and the payment card industry's data security standards (PCI-DSS).
* Fill apps/websites with content, including technical support for users.
* Promote apps/websites with a variety of on and off-line tools.
* Analyze traffic with a variety of tools and use this analysis to determine which marketing channels provide the highest return on investment.
* Relentlessly chase higher and higher returns on investment.p
 
My experience as an entrepreneur and working with early stage technology companies has significantly changed my views about marketing. Consequently, I am a little more product obsessed than most other marketers. My obsession with product has lead me to focus on usability and reliability over raw technical brilliance. It has also lead me to consider functions like technical support, quality assurance (especially pre-release), and user experience as marketing functions.

Working for myself and other entrepreneurs has also made me rather obsessive about revenue. Years of making cold calls and closing inbound leads has turned me into a pretty decent salesperson and I am particularly good at taking a new product, earning it its first 50 users, and using their insights to chase a better product-market fit.
