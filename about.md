### About me

My name is Greg Hluska and I am a highly technical marketer from Regina, Canada.

### About this site

When I first went online, the concept of serving content from a database was totally foreign to me. My site was all static HTML because that's just how it was done. Then, I made a few changes to my main menu, had to manually update that on 80 static HTML pages, and promptly got into PHP includes.

From there, it was an easy decision to start using Wordpress. WP made blogging so easy that it was my default choice for years and years and years.

But, a few years ago, I started using [http://www.leanpub.com](Leanpub) for long form writing and got kind of obsessed with Markdown. I found that armed with Git, Markdown and [fargo.io](Fargo.io), I was a significantly more productive writer. This severely hurt my blogging - going from my new flow back to Wordpress felt like jogging in quicksand. So, I started looking for new options.

Jekyll was instantly attractive to me and, since I was already using Git, I thought that for my next version of my website, I would try hosting my site on Github Pages. It feels funny writing an about page in a text editor - I have grown so used to Wordpress over the years that I associate writing for the web with its interfaace. It also feels funny knowing that after all these years, my website is fully static again.
